NeckSnake Device with an Android App

This is the Android game part of the NeckSnake Device project. We built a neck protector device to protect your neck after long time working without moving your neck. It contained an android application and an Arduino board connected with muscle sensors and Bluetooth module. The device can monitor the condition of userâ€™s neck muscle and allow user to play Android games using his neck to control the snake in order to exercise his neck.
